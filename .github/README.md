Secondly we like to invite you to our [Telegram](https://t.me/ArkaneNetworkOfficial) channel so we can answer any questions you may have and help you where needed.

## Why add a blockchain provider?
Arkane network consists out of multiple building blocks, by adding support for an extra blockchain, the blockchain is not only supported by the [Arkane web wallet](https://arkane.network) but by **ALL** Arkane components. Allowing the creation of userfriendly blockchain applications without the need for browser extensions.

## Modules

### Provider API

The provider API is the actual API. All provider submodules needs to implement the interfaces of the API.

### Provider AutoConfiguration

**Spring Boot Autoconfiguration** module. Using this module, spring will automatically populate all required elements to interact with the various
blockchain submodules.

### Provider XXX 

For every supported blockchain, a new provider is added.
